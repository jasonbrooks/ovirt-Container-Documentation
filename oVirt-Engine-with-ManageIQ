1. Make sure that the Docker service is running:

$ sudo service docker start

or

$ sudo systemctl start docker.service

2. Use the Docker image of ManageIQ available at Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/manageiq/manageiq/
Pull the Docker image as follows: 

$ sudo docker pull manageiq/manageiq:fine-3
  
At present, the tag is `fine:3` but that changes with time, so to be sure go to manageiq/download to see what the latest tag is.

2. Run the container

sudo docker run --name ovirt-manageiq --privileged -d -p 8443:443 manageiq/manageiq:fine-3
